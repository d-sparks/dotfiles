To configure:
  - Change the "default_dir" setting in the preferences file `Explore/Explore (OSX).sublime-settings`.
  - If you want (recommended) go into `Explore/Default (OSX).sublime-keymap` and copy the keybinding for `enter` into your own custom keybindings. (Can't figure out how to get this to work X_X without this step.)

Press `super+e` to open the exploration menu, you can use arrows or vim bindings to move around, or quicksearch, and hit enter to navigate. Escape brings you back to the '..' line. You can open documents by pressing enter, or use `cmd+enter` to open something without closing the exploration view. These bindings can be changed in the `Explore/Default (OSX).sublime-keymap` file.

Again -- its in super crude shape, but I've been using it constantly since I made it (months ago) so I thought I'd share.
